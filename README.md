The [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth) is a low-cost acoustic recorder designed by [Open Acoustic Devices](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/) for wildlife and conservation applications. 

This [practical guide](guide.md) is a repository for all of the tips, tricks, and procedures we, the [Kitzes Lab](http://www.kitzeslab.org/), developed in the process of deploying thousands of AudioMoths since March 2018.


## Quick start

AudioMoths are simple to set up out of the box. For instance:

* Purchase AudioMoths, microSD cards, and batteries
* Insert batteries and microSD card into AudioMoth
* Download the [configuration app](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/applications) to your computer
* Use the app to create a recording schedule for the AudioMoth to record on; this is explained with graphics on the [AudioMoth Config App tutorial](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/config-app-guide) and in detail in the guide.
* Connect AudioMoth to computer to set the clock and apply the configuration
* Flip switch to "CUSTOM" to start recording on schedule

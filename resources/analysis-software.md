# Bioacoustics software

A variety of free and paid software is available for bioacoustic analyses. Software packages vary from complete graphical interfaces, to command-line interfaces, to utility libraries that can be used to create analysis pipelines in Python, R, or other programming languages. 

The inclusion criteria for this list are (1) that the software is targeted to or widely used by bioacoustics researchers, and (2) that the software either is stable, is currently in active development, or was recently released. 

This list is not necessarily a recommendation or a guarantee of quality of particular software packages or analysis techniques, but I have indicated in **bold** which software I've seen used most frequently. I haven't used all of the software below. Some I use frequently and can't live without, whereas some I haven't found to be useful or accurate for my purposes.

You should always judge the performance of an analysis method by its performance on *your* dataset. Analysis methods are often published along with metrics to describe their performance, such as accuracy, precision, and recall. However, different recording conditions or different distributions of sounds present in your dataset can result in starkly different performance of the same method.

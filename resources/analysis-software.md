# Bioacoustics software list (moved [here](https://github.com/rhine3/bioacoustics-software))

The list previously located here started to take on a life of its own, so I moved it to its own dedicated repository. 

**View the current list of bioacoustics software at https://github.com/rhine3/bioacoustics-software.**
